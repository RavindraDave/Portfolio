          <h2>Tech Enthusiast + Full Stack Developer</h2>

          <p>As a developer, I specialize in creating modular and scalable application with n-tier architectures. Most of my expirence is in .NET tehcnologies, but Python is my latest interest, due to it's vast usage and ease to automate recursive day to day task :)</p>
          <p>I’m also exploring more creative pursuits creating applications in different CSS and JS framework.</p>

            <h3>Database Back and Restore</h3>
            <p>When I started my career in FinIQ, while working on different project, often I need to setup/backup/restore databases for different projects, specially when working on local PC. Many developer are not familiar with database maintance commands, so I developed simple utility in .NET, which saves lot of time and efforts while setting up new database instance.</p>

              <h3>The Wire Ipsum</h3>
              <p>After coming back from teaching a JavaScript workshop, I felt inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all the content/lorem ipsum generators available, there was nothing for HBO’s The Wire fans. I searched for <a href="http://thewireipsum.com" target="_blank">thewireipsum.com</a> domain and it was available! Generate some content for your projects today.</p>
